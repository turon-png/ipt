        <h1>About Me</h1>


        <section>
            <h2>Personal Information</h2>
            <p>My name is Carizza Jhayne Bustamante, and I am 20 years old. I live in Bacnotan, La Union, Philippines,
                and I am currently a second-year college student. Let me take you through the first five years of my
                life. I was born on June 13, 2004, in Montalban, Rodriguez, Rizal. For the first three years of my life,
                I lived with my grandmother (Lola), and I began my studies in Pasay City, Philippines. I later
                transferred and completed Grades 1 and 2 at Tagumpay National High School in Rizal, as I was living with
                my mother at the time. After finishing Grades 1 and 2, I moved back to Pasay City to live with my
                grandparents and completed my elementary and junior high school years (Grades 7 and 8) at Kalayaan
                National High School.
                In 2018, we were preparing to move to La Union, so I transferred back to Tagumpay National High School.
                I completed my remaining junior high school years (Grades 9 and 10) in Montalban. Then, when I entered
                Senior High School, I moved to La Union, where I have been living with my grandparents for 15 years now
                (YES, I LOVE MY GRANDPARENTS VERY MUCH). Currently, I am a second-year college student at Lorma
                Colleges.
                To this day, we still live in La Union, a place that holds so many fond memories for me. My favorite
                spot here is San Juan, as I find the sea incredibly calming and peaceful. The sound of the waves
                crashing on the shore always helps clear my mind. Whenever my friends and I go out, we often pass
                through San Juan to unwind, relax, and talk about life. It’s become our go-to place where we can
                reflect, share our thoughts, and enjoy the beauty of the beach. Every visit feels like a much-needed
                escape, a moment to recharge and appreciate the simple joys of life.
                I also found some amazing new friends at Lorma. Kath, Mary, Ate Erika, and Grezamel. They’ve truly made
                my college years so much more fun and bearable. We always have a great time together, sharing endless
                laughs, joking around about our other classmates, and sometimes even poking fun at the little things
                that annoy us. It’s so refreshing to be surrounded by people who not only understand my sense of humor
                but also share the same pet peeves, making our bond even stronger. Their friendship has really been a
                source of comfort and joy throughout my college journey.
                When I don’t have anything to do, I usually spend my time cleaning my room and chatting with my
                wonderful girlfriend. Our conversations are always so enjoyable and meaningful. I also love to cook,
                especially making snacks, and I take great pleasure in preparing meals for my family. There's something
                special about seeing them enjoy the food I make. In addition, I have two playful dogs, Arya and Woody,
                who bring so much joy into our life. I love spending time with them, whether it's playing, going for
                walks, or just cuddling. They always know how to brighten my day and keep me company when I need it
                most.
                My favorite food is chicken and waffles because it was my comfort food when I was a child. I play sports
                like basketball, table tennis, and badminton, but my favorite is lawn tennis. I remember during my
                junior high and elementary school days, I used to represent my school in various competitions. I also
                represented my region as part of the NCR team. To this day, I still play lawn tennis, but I am no longer
                competing for my school. Sometimes, I join tournaments in places like Ilocos, Baguio, and Nueva Ecija. I
                truly enjoy playing lawn tennis because I know it is something I love.
                I also have five siblings, and I am the second child. I have two nephews and one niece. When I was in
                Grade 1 and Grade 2 in Montalban, I attended the same school as my older brother (Kuya), and I remember
                that we loved to walk home together after school. Today, my Kuya and my brother are living in Montalban,
                while my sister and I are living here in La Union.
                Let me share a bit about my interests. Japanese cuisine holds a special place in my heart, and it's at
                the top of my travel bucket list. Once I graduate and have saved up enough, my dream is to visit Japan
                to experience its authentic flavors firsthand. After that, I’d love to explore Switzerland, as I’ve
                always been captivated by the beauty of its mountains and the charm of its snowy landscapes.
                Now, let me tell you a bit about my love life. I have a wonderful girlfriend who lives in Baguio, and
                she’s a third-year nursing student. Whenever I have some free time, I visit her in Baguio, and when
                she’s able to, she comes to La Union to spend time with me. One of our favorite things to do together is
                explore new places and travel, creating memories along the way.
                My goal after I graduate is to pursue a profession that I am truly passionate about, one that aligns
                with my skills and interests. I want to build a career that not only brings me personal fulfillment but
                also allows me to grow professionally. At the same time, I plan to save up enough money to eventually
                open my own business. This will give me the opportunity to invest in something I’m passionate about and
                secure my financial future. By doing so, I hope to ensure that my money is not just being spent, but is
                also working for me to generate additional income. My dream is to create a stable and successful life,
                where I can both enjoy my work and achieve financial independence.
                That's all for this activity! I hope you enjoyed reading about my experiences and getting to know more
                about me. It’s been a pleasure sharing a glimpse into my life. I hope you don't judge me.
            </p>
